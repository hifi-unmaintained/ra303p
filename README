Red Alert 3.03 "p" series
-------------------------

Building requirements:

 * make
 * gcc
 * nasm
 * ra95.dat (from ra303eng.zip)

Tools to modify ra95.dat in tools/. Just type "make" when you have ra95.dat in
the root directory to apply the patches.

The PE section insert tool, "extpe" might not be production quality for
anything else than Red Alert. I hope it can be perfected to add a section to 
any image without causing problems for the running program.

I hope this evolves into something useful!
