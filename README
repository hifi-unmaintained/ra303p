Red Alert 3.03 "p" series
-------------------------

Building requirements:

 * make
 * gcc
 * nasm
 * ra95.dat (from ra303eng.zip)

Tools to modify ra95.dat in tools/, actual code in src/.

Just type "make" when you have ra95.dat in the root directory to apply the
patches.

The PE modify tool, "modpe" might not be production quality for anything else
than Red Alert. I hope it can be perfected to expand any section in the image
without causing any problems for the running program.

I hope this evolves into something useful!
