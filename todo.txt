41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword, like this:
	1. when reading a scenario, zero out of buffer to hold the map name in for the next map in the campaign

	3. if the player loses, zero out this buffer
	4. if the player wins, load the next map in this buffer
