1. need to check if submarine decloak fix doesnt break multiplayer sonar pulse submarine decloak logic

2. oos-fix.ini causes attack cursor to appaear on technolgoy center when you hover over it, instead of the bomb cursor.

3. oos-fix.ini isn't applied to savegames.

4. aftermath game "off" text needs to be adjusted for hires

5. Mine fix offset 0x00555A48, desyncs online probably. fix is to move 800080h into ecx

6. Units getting into unpassable terrain need to fix somewhere around 0x0045C2F3, use  CellClass::Adjacent_Cell(FacingType) to get the cell below if building is Iron Curtain or Tesla Coil

7. savegames speed is different

8.s

23 I keep forgetting to mention, not exactly a bug, but the Cargo Truck did not have a shadow until
Aftermath, yet in Aftermath, the fixed SHP with the shadow is inside conquer.mix (and not expand2.mix), so if you play the original
campaign or Counterstrike missions, you still get the old Cargo Truck without the shadow (this is non-issue for the TFD version, I suppose).
Basically, putting the new version of the SHP inside expand2.mix should fix it.

16. Update language packs with FunkyFr3sh's versions

17. add session type check to sonar pulse when only vessels exist for house code

22. Mention all non-code patches in my patch notes.

23. Add different colour remaps for buildings and units
Feb 20 23:39:21 <iran> CCHyper: yeah TechnoClass offset 0x10 has the vftable with value 0x5F73E000 for BuildingClass
red colour remap is 0x00666B3E
NOTE: MCV should have building colour!

21. Check out arda auto adjust on game grid option and check where to find it. It only works in windowed mode under cnc-ddraw and modifies width and height based on something, probably game height/width - (height/width % cell size in pixels), need to add launcher logic so this only gets enabled in windowed mode (enable/disable when windowed mode checkbox is changeed and make sure to do a check while saving options)

9. Fix Radar Dome crash.

10. Fix engi Q freeze.
[23:54:22] <FunkyFr3sh> click 1-2 spots on the terrain then attack another tank etc etc .. never let Q go

11. selecting a harvester target ore patch on the radar minimap shows a "can't go there" cursor instead of the attack cursor.

can't move is mousetype 0x11, attack is 16, actiontype move is 1 or 2



Todo for later:
--------------------------------------
18. There's graphical glitching in the no-refresh area of the sidebar with the keybar toggle key in 640x480, need to copy code from options menu to clear buffer. This code might be useful to fix graphical glitching on maps smaller than reso.

19. Look into adding black map border tiles. add clear1.int to all theaters, don't forget to REMOVE hires patch to not display map broder

9. Update forceAM and forceAMfastbuildspeed rules.ini files to use updated oos-fix.ini to prevent issues with barrels in single player etc

10. Add option to not have ai build mad tanks

11. Add option to not have ai build demo trucks

12. Add option to not have ai build radar jammer

12. Add "Unable to build more" sound when tank limit is reached

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

Invisible Explosion Fixed
Explosion animations of warheads with Explosion=4 and Damage from 45 to 75 (inclusive) were hidden on certain buildings, also depending on the firing angle. For instance, this affected the Chrono Tank's missiles against Construction Yards. (MAKE SURE TO CHECK WHETHER THIS CAUSES DESYNCS ONLINE OR NOT)

Affected explosion animations made visible.

41. Add rules.ini keyword to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh

have them make spen too, ai might build missile subs if they have tech center, note that the AI only builds one kennel but builds multiple of these buildings..

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

47. [19:03:39] <iran> i think it's because of the code that blacks the borders of the main menu graphic
[19:03:48] <iran> it works by clearing the background whenever a pcx file is loaded
[19:04:00] <iran> which is done for the credits screen with that file


56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

30. In the single player score screen sometimes the Soviet casualities number display is blue instead of red

49. A few message boxes and in-game things reference "Command & Conquer" instead of "Red Alert".

40. Add a rules.ini keyword to not have the AI sell their structures when all production facilities are destroyed

45. Add extra colour remaps

41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword by checking a call to Map_Selection and replacing it

38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
25. hires LAN join screen WIP crashes with more multiplayer countries enabled
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7 (using the unfinished one as base)

EDIT: Seems that if you join someones game who has a custom and map it starts transfering and you hit cancel you get "Unable to Read" scenario, hit ok and it goes to desktop, rather than back to the lobby.

57. add support for saving skirmish games (CCHyper said this might brveak things), this breaks a lot of things and I need to figure out why)

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
