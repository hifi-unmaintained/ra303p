41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword, like this:
	1. when reading a scenario, zero out of buffer to hold the map name in for the next map in the campaign
	2. then while still reading a scenario, read the keyword to set a map to load next if found
	3. if the player loses, zero out this buffer
	4. if the player wins, load the next map in this buffer
