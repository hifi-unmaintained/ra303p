1. IMPORTANT CHECK IF SOME OF THE AI PATCHES DONT BREAK 3.03 ONLINE COMPATIBILITY

2. Check out patching out check at 0x004D70B8, this might be responsible for noy allowing you to chronoshift enemies

3. For Iron Curtain check patching a jump to 0x004D6F0A at 0x004D6EEC

4. at 0x004D70C9 there seems to be checks for what you can chronoshift or not

7. Should update threading issue dialog in launcher to have a "don't display this warning again" checkbox and modify so it only doesnt show again if that is ticked isntead of just showing the dialog box once.

9. Update forceAM and forceAMfastbuildspeed rules.ini files to use updated oos-fix.ini to prevent issues with barrels in single player etc

10. center receiving/sending remote file dialog

11. center reconnecting dialog ingame

44. [20:48:35] <iran> need to center the receiving file from remote host dialog

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

Invisible Explosion Fixed
Explosion animations of warheads with Explosion=4 and Damage from 45 to 75 (inclusive) were hidden on certain buildings, also depending on the firing angle. For instance, this affected the Chrono Tank's missiles against Construction Yards. (MAKE SURE TO CHECK WHETHER THIS CAUSES DESYNCS ONLINE OR NOT)

Affected explosion animations made visible.

56. update briefing for missing campaign to new project page url

64. Add a dialog box for when the game is starting in LAN mode

41. Add rules.ini keyword to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh

have them make spen too, ai might build missile subs if they have tech center, note that the AI only builds one kennel but builds multiple of these buildings..

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

47. [19:03:39] <iran> i think it's because of the code that blacks the borders of the main menu graphic
[19:03:48] <iran> it works by clearing the background whenever a pcx file is loaded
[19:04:00] <iran> which is done for the credits screen with that file


Todo for later:
--------------------------------------

30. In the single player score screen sometimes the Soviet casualities number display is blue instead of red

49. A few message boxes and in-game things reference "Command & Conquer" instead of "Red Alert".

All 3.03 patch strings are hard-coded:
[14:08:49] <FunkyFr3sh> "draw" and "aftermath missions ..."
[14:08:52] <FunkyFr3sh> thats prolyl the only ones

40. Add a rules.ini keyword to not have the AI sell their structures when all production facilities are destroyed
45. Add extra colour remaps
41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword, like this:
	1. when reading a scenario, zero out of buffer to hold the map name in for the next map in the campaign
	2. then while still reading a scenario, read the keyword to set a map to load next if found
	3. if the player loses, zero out this buffer
	4. if the player wins, load the next map in this buffer
38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
25. hires LAN join screen WIP crashes with more multiplayer countries enabled
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7 (using the unfinished one as base)

16. Finish custom missions loading code, the custom missions are displayed but the internal scenarios are still played
17. Need to check if new missions dialog still shows when Counterstrike expansion isn't enabled
19. Load map specific tutorial.ini if found else load the normal tutorial.ini file.
21. Fix any FileClass leaks in the custom mission list ini loading code

EDIT: Seems that if you join someones game who has a custom and map it starts transfering and you hit cancel you get "Unable to Read" scenario, hit ok and it goes to desktop, rather than back to the lobby.

57. add support for saving skirmish games (CCHyper said this might brveak things), this breaks a lot of things and I need to figure out why)

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
