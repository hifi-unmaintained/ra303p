41. Update PortableRA build.txt

43. fix crash with projectiles going off map? hifi has a fix for this

44. [20:48:35] <iran> need to center the receiving file from remote host dialog

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

53. my patched cnc-ddraw doesn't seem to work on windows xp

54. need to adjust video stretching code to work if ddraw resolution is higher than the real resolution (when ddraw is used for resolution stretching)

56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

Invisible Explosion Fixed
Explosion animations of warheads with Explosion=4 and Damage from 45 to 75 (inclusive) were hidden on certain buildings, also depending on the firing angle. For instance, this affected the Chrono Tank's missiles against Construction Yards.

Affected explosion animations made visible.

62. Need to add code to make sidebar resolution independent for saves.

64. Add a dialog box for when the game is starting in LAN mode

41. Add rules.ini keywords to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh

have them make spen too, ai might build missile subs if they have tech center

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

45. Add extra colour remaps

Todo for later:
--------------------------------------


41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword, like this:
	1. when reading a scenario, zero out of buffer to hold the map name in for the next map in the campaign
	2. then while still reading a scenario, read the keyword to set a map to load next if found
	3. if the player loses, zero out this buffer
	4. if the player wins, load the next map in this buffer
38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
25. hires LAN join screen WIP crashes with more multiplayer countries enabled
33. Update the file check sum check once funky fixed oos-fix.ini
39. Resign key doesn't work if fixed it should show the dialog.
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7

13. Fix extended sidebar code, arda uses new sidebar graphics to get this right
16. Finish custom missions loading code, the custom missions are displayed but the internal scenarios are still played
17. Need to check if new missions dialog still shows when Counterstrike expansion isn't enabled
19. Load map specific tutorial.ini if found else load the normal tutorial.ini file.
21. Fix any FileClass leaks in the custom mission list ini loading code

57. add support for saving skirmish games (CCHyper said this might brveak things), this breaks a lot of things and I need to figure out why)

[23:17:25] <CCHyper_> iirc, they are getting target coords as 0,0
[23:17:46] <CCHyper_> rather than getting a target object, then fetching its coords
[23:17:58] <CCHyper_> debug
[23:18:03] <CCHyper_> Assign_Destination()
[23:18:14] <CCHyper_> UnitClass::Assign_Destination()

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
