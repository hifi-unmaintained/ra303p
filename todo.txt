17. Don't forget to update version info ingame to show 303p-iB1

4. Holy Grounds cause Out of Sync at start

5. test fixed version of conflict cove extreme with original version

6. Some of the music that loops and isn't supposed to play still gets chosen as random starting song

8. need to check if editor downloads on PortableRA site are updated and update the installer so it places the updated editor in the main game folder.

9. Fix Radar Dome crash.

10. Fix engi Q freeze.
[23:54:22] <FunkyFr3sh> click 1-2 spots on the terrain then attack another tank etc etc .. never let Q go

11. selecting a harvester target ore patch on the radar minimap shows a "can't go there" cursor instead of the attack cursor.

12. Fix 'Negoations' expansion mission

16. Update language packs with FunkyFr3sh's versions

18. There's graphical glitching in the no-refresh area of the sidebar with the keybar toggle key in 640x480, need to copy code from options menu to clear buffer. This code might be useful to fix graphical glitching on maps smaller than reso.

19. Look into adding black map border tiles. add clear1.int to all theaters, don't forget to REMOVE hires patch to not display map broder

20. Check if chrono vortex shows up in new theaters

21. Check out arda auto adjust on game grid option and check where to find it

--------------------------------------
9. Update forceAM and forceAMfastbuildspeed rules.ini files to use updated oos-fix.ini to prevent issues with barrels in single player etc

10. Add option to not have ai build mad tanks

11. Add option to not have ai build demo trucks

12. Add option to not have ai build radar jammer

12. Add "Unable to build more" sound when tank limit is reached

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

Invisible Explosion Fixed
Explosion animations of warheads with Explosion=4 and Damage from 45 to 75 (inclusive) were hidden on certain buildings, also depending on the firing angle. For instance, this affected the Chrono Tank's missiles against Construction Yards. (MAKE SURE TO CHECK WHETHER THIS CAUSES DESYNCS ONLINE OR NOT)

Affected explosion animations made visible.

41. Add rules.ini keyword to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh

have them make spen too, ai might build missile subs if they have tech center, note that the AI only builds one kennel but builds multiple of these buildings..

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

47. [19:03:39] <iran> i think it's because of the code that blacks the borders of the main menu graphic
[19:03:48] <iran> it works by clearing the background whenever a pcx file is loaded
[19:04:00] <iran> which is done for the credits screen with that file

55. Add support for Desert and Winter theater from C&C1, see (need to make game allocate larger heap/buffer for theater stuff probably):
http://forums.cncnz.com/topic/13910-106c-development-topic/page-36#entry210648

56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

30. In the single player score screen sometimes the Soviet casualities number display is blue instead of red

49. A few message boxes and in-game things reference "Command & Conquer" instead of "Red Alert".

40. Add a rules.ini keyword to not have the AI sell their structures when all production facilities are destroyed

45. Add extra colour remaps

41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword by checking a call to Map_Selection and replacing it

38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
25. hires LAN join screen WIP crashes with more multiplayer countries enabled
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7 (using the unfinished one as base)

EDIT: Seems that if you join someones game who has a custom and map it starts transfering and you hit cancel you get "Unable to Read" scenario, hit ok and it goes to desktop, rather than back to the lobby.

57. add support for saving skirmish games (CCHyper said this might brveak things), this breaks a lot of things and I need to figure out why)

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
