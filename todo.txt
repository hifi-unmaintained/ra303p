40. Check out the arda auto-adjust on grid stuff

41. Update PortableRA build.txt

44. [20:48:35] <iran> need to center the receiving file from remote host dialog

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

Invisible Explosion Fixed
Explosion animations of warheads with Explosion=4 and Damage from 45 to 75 (inclusive) were hidden on certain buildings, also depending on the firing angle. For instance, this affected the Chrono Tank's missiles against Construction Yards. (MAKE SURE TO CHECK WHETHER THIS CAUSES DESYNCS ONLINE OR NOT)

Affected explosion animations made visible.

64. Add a dialog box for when the game is starting in LAN mode

42. Add a rules.ini keyword to give allow people to get parabombs even when game isn't multiplayer
AUTO:004D5B13                 cmp     ds:SessionClass Session, 0
AUTO:004D5B1A                 jnz     short loc_4D5B5A

check is done here

41. Add rules.ini keyword to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh

have them make spen too, ai might build missile subs if they have tech center, note that the AI only builds one kennel but builds multiple of these buildings..

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

43. 480x640 westwood logo selection and ant missions stereo selection areas are incorrectly positioned

44. Make the launcher show a messagebox when run mentioning the issue with single/multiCPU. Make the message box have a checkbox to not display this messagebox in the future.

45. remove the INI expansion maps

46. [14:24:49] <iran> what language packs are there for red alert? I'll make the game load LANGUAGElanguagepack.mix
[14:25:10] <iran> and for german germancensoredlanguagepack.mix and germanuncensoredlanguagepack.mix
[14:25:20] <iran> in addition to germanlanguagepack.mix

47. [19:03:39] <iran> i think it's because of the code that blacks the borders of the main menu graphic
[19:03:48] <iran> it works by clearing the background whenever a pcx file is loaded
[19:04:00] <iran> which is done for the credits screen with that file

Todo for later:
--------------------------------------

49. A few message boxes and in-game things reference "Command & Conquer" instead of "Red Alert".

All 3.03 patch strings are hard-coded:
[14:08:49] <FunkyFr3sh> "draw" and "aftermath missions ..."
[14:08:52] <FunkyFr3sh> thats prolyl the only ones

40. Add a rules.ini keyword to not have the AI sell their structures when all production facilities are destroyed
45. Add extra colour remaps
41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword, like this:
	1. when reading a scenario, zero out of buffer to hold the map name in for the next map in the campaign
	2. then while still reading a scenario, read the keyword to set a map to load next if found
	3. if the player loses, zero out this buffer
	4. if the player wins, load the next map in this buffer
38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
25. hires LAN join screen WIP crashes with more multiplayer countries enabled
33. Update the file check sum check once funky fixed oos-fix.ini (seems oos-fix.ini works fine now)
39. Resign key doesn't work if fixed it should show the dialog. (see 0x004A54DB for dialog code)
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7 (using the unfinished one as base)

13. Fix extended sidebar code, arda uses new sidebar graphics to get this right
16. Finish custom missions loading code, the custom missions are displayed but the internal scenarios are still played
17. Need to check if new missions dialog still shows when Counterstrike expansion isn't enabled
19. Load map specific tutorial.ini if found else load the normal tutorial.ini file.
21. Fix any FileClass leaks in the custom mission list ini loading code

57. add support for saving skirmish games (CCHyper said this might brveak things), this breaks a lot of things and I need to figure out why)

[23:17:25] <CCHyper_> iirc, they are getting target coords as 0,0
[23:17:46] <CCHyper_> rather than getting a target object, then fetching its coords
[23:17:58] <CCHyper_> debug
[23:18:03] <CCHyper_> Assign_Destination()
[23:18:14] <CCHyper_> UnitClass::Assign_Destination()

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
