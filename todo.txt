- The custom graphics for extended sidebar are in WOLAPI.mix, they should be inside redalert.mix but that doesn't load for some reason

1. Corrupted fail video for first allies mission

[19:32:40] <poksi> File size: 213.0KB - Content-Type: application/zip
[19:32:52] <FunkyFr3sh> language packs: http://redalert95.tk/a/rand/ra-german.7z

7. add a check for einstein and GRNL evac whether the game is single player or not

44. [20:48:35] <iran> need to center the receiving file from remote host dialog

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

Invisible Explosion Fixed
Explosion animations of warheads with Explosion=4 and Damage from 45 to 75 (inclusive) were hidden on certain buildings, also depending on the firing angle. For instance, this affected the Chrono Tank's missiles against Construction Yards. (MAKE SURE TO CHECK WHETHER THIS CAUSES DESYNCS ONLINE OR NOT)

Affected explosion animations made visible.

56. update briefing for missing campaign to new project page url

64. Add a dialog box for when the game is starting in LAN mode

41. Add rules.ini keyword to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh

have them make spen too, ai might build missile subs if they have tech center, note that the AI only builds one kennel but builds multiple of these buildings..

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

47. [19:03:39] <iran> i think it's because of the code that blacks the borders of the main menu graphic
[19:03:48] <iran> it works by clearing the background whenever a pcx file is loaded
[19:04:00] <iran> which is done for the credits screen with that file


Todo for later:
--------------------------------------

30. In the single player score screen sometimes the Soviet casualities number display is blue instead of red

49. A few message boxes and in-game things reference "Command & Conquer" instead of "Red Alert".

All 3.03 patch strings are hard-coded:
[14:08:49] <FunkyFr3sh> "draw" and "aftermath missions ..."
[14:08:52] <FunkyFr3sh> thats prolyl the only ones

40. Add a rules.ini keyword to not have the AI sell their structures when all production facilities are destroyed
45. Add extra colour remaps
41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword, like this:
	1. when reading a scenario, zero out of buffer to hold the map name in for the next map in the campaign
	2. then while still reading a scenario, read the keyword to set a map to load next if found
	3. if the player loses, zero out this buffer
	4. if the player wins, load the next map in this buffer
38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
25. hires LAN join screen WIP crashes with more multiplayer countries enabled
39. Resign key doesn't work if fixed it should show the dialog. (see 0x004A54DB for dialog code)
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7 (using the unfinished one as base)

13. Fix extended sidebar code, arda uses new sidebar graphics to get this right
16. Finish custom missions loading code, the custom missions are displayed but the internal scenarios are still played
17. Need to check if new missions dialog still shows when Counterstrike expansion isn't enabled
19. Load map specific tutorial.ini if found else load the normal tutorial.ini file.
21. Fix any FileClass leaks in the custom mission list ini loading code

EDIT: Seems that if you join someones game who has a custom and map it starts transfering and you hit cancel you get "Unable to Read" scenario, hit ok and it goes to desktop, rather than back to the lobby.

57. add support for saving skirmish games (CCHyper said this might brveak things), this breaks a lot of things and I need to figure out why)

[23:17:25] <CCHyper_> iirc, they are getting target coords as 0,0
[23:17:46] <CCHyper_> rather than getting a target object, then fetching its coords
[23:17:58] <CCHyper_> debug
[23:18:03] <CCHyper_> Assign_Destination()
[23:18:14] <CCHyper_> UnitClass::Assign_Destination()

argument in EDX for call at 0x00580F04 sometimes is zero.

calls for UnitClass::Assign_Destination():
return to 0x00562666 (UnitClass::Unlimbo()
return to 0x0057BC74 (UnitClass::Try_To_Deploy())
return to 0x004C1A96 (FootClass::Mission_Guard_Area())
return to 0x004B728B  (DriveClass::Start_Of_Move())
return to 0x004C272F (FootClass::Per_Cell_Process())
return to 0x004B7F0F (DriveClass::AI())
return to 0x0058171F (UnitClass::Scatter())
return to 0x0057E3BD (UnitClass::Mission_Harvest())
return to 0x0057D0C7 (UnitClass::Go_To_Tiberium())
return to 0x004B712B (UnitClass::Start_Of_Move())
return to 0x004B75E0 (DriveClass::Start_Of_Move())

FootClass::Mission_Guard_Area() seems at fault and more directly UnitClass::Mission_Guard_Area()

LOOKS LIKE IT STILL MIGHT BE IN HOUSECLASS::AI_Attack(), the code doesn't just seem to be called for attack waves

TRY ADDING A CHECK FOR return of zone 0 for both calls to HouseClass::Which_Zone(ObjectClass *)

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
