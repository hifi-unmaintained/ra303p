1. Load any BLACKBACKGROUND.PCX files if found before TITLE.PCX title screen graphic to prevent glitching around menu borders after playing missions in certain cases.
2. If a TITLE.PCX is found that doesn't have the same dimensions as the original TITLE.PCX file, it will be displayed on the screen in the top left, this allows people to create their own custom main menu title graphics and if them work with hi-res.

3. FunkyFre3sh's OOS-FIX.INI file will be loaded (if it's found) while still being compatible online with 3.03 players not using this fix. This fix prevents desyncing after playing certain (most?) modded maps online and then playing another map. It also fixes the cause of the desync itself, namely that after playing certain modded maps/missions certain memory used by the game for its settings (e.g. unit cost) won't be reset when playing a normal map/mission. This has to do with some really terrible programming but is a bit technical to explain. Suffice to say this fixes things like the Mobile Radar Jammer gaining a Tesla weapon after playing certain Counterstrike missions, etc.

4. VQA640 files are now centered, only the intro sequence with a Longbow helicopter hitting a Mammoth Tank is a VQA640 file though.

5. Messages sent by other players during a match now appear for 30 seconds in the top left corner, instead of the previous 9 seconds.
6. There are a max of 12 messages, instead of the previous 6 max. More than 7 messages shown cause minor graphicl glitching until the additional messages disappear.

7. Added an redalert.ini boolean option "ShowAllMusic" under the "Options" section to enable/disable showing all music, normally the game only shows some music depending on what side you're planning as, with this option enabled, it always shows all music, except for the score, map and main menu music.

8. All multiplayer settings are now configurable, inside redalert.ini add:
[MultiplayerDefaults]
Money=10000
ShroudRegrows=false
CaptureTheFlag=false
Crates=false
Bases=true
OreRegenerates=true
UnitCount=0
TechLevel=10
AIDifficulty=2
AIPlayers=1
MapIndex=2

9. Extra songs can be added in a music.ini file.
10. The game now tries to load the The Lost Files movies compiled by Nyerguds.
11. The game will now load and play sizzle3.vqa, sizzle4.vqa and introx.vqa in the sneak preview menu if found.
12. Playing the ENGLISH.VQA intro is now optional. a new REDALERT.INI boolean option PlayEnglishIntro= under the "Options" section controls this.
13. Fixed the in-game displayed name of various songs, Twin Cannon misnamed as "Twin" and most Counterstrike songs.

14. The game now doesn't start playing another song anymore when it regains focus (via alt+tab for example).

15. Fix for a rare issue where the game would report there is barely any free disk space left when there's plenty. The game now always thinks there is enough free disk space left.

16. Greece, Spain and Turkey are now all selectable in multiplayer.

17. Fix added for cnc-ddraw crash in the credits slide show screen once the first text reaches the top of the screen.

18. New rules.ini AftermathFastBuildSpeed= yes/no keyword under the section [Aftermath], with this enabled the build speed will be fast even when the Aftermath expansion is installed. Enabling this option makes rules.ini incompatible with vanilla 3.03 online. If you want to use this online you need to play versus other players running this patch and the "Force AM fast build speed" rules.ini file (this is also available as a RedAlertConfig.exe option).

19. New command-line arguments:
-NEWMISSIONS: enables the new missions system explained elsewhere in this text.
-ANTMISSIONS: Starts the ant missions campaign if the Counterstrike expansion is enabled.
-SKIRMISH: Loads the skirmish menu.
-LAN: Loads the LAN menu.

20. Optional deinterlacing of videos, this is controlled by the VideoInterlaceMode= keyword in REDALERT.INI under the [Options] section, if set to 2 videos are deinterlaced, with 0 they're horizontally interlaced and with 1 they're supposed to be vertically interlaced (though the vertical interlacing doesn't seem to work)

21. Score screen skipping with the option SkipScoreScreen= yes/no in REDALERT.INI under the [Options] section.

22. The game no longer requires mpgdll.dll. This DLL is never used.
